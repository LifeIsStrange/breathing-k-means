Origin of the data sets
=======================

2D data sets from the literature (obtained from http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/)

• ”Jain”: Jain and Law (2005)
• ”R15”, ”D31”: Veenman et al. (2002)
• ”Aggregation”: Gionis et al. (2007)
• ”Flame”: Fu and Medico (2007)
• ”Spiral”: Chang and Yeung (2008)
• ”S2”: Fränti and Virmajoki (2006)
• ”Unbalance”: Rezaei and Fränti (2016)
• ”Birch1”, ”Birch2”: Zhang et al. (1997)

self-generated 2D data sets (see preprint https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15666 for a description)

• "gmd5x5"
• "gmd8x8"
• "noise"
• "vardensity"
• "uniform"
• "sq6x6-2x2"
• "randangles"
• "stains"
• "correlated"
• "rice"

Higer-dimensional data sets:

• "Norm25-new": This data set was generated from a mixture of 25 Gaussians in 15-dimensional space
  following a description of the Norm25 dataset from the original k-means++ publication
• "Cloud": This data set is 10-dimensional and stems from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cloud
  from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
• "Intrusion": This data set was extracted from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/kdd+cup+1999+data
  from the UCI Machine Learning Repository by taking the file kddcup.data_10_percent.gz and 
  selecting the 35 numeric features (from a total of 42). 
• "Spam": This data set is 58-dimensional and  stems from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase
  from the UCI Machine Learning Repository
